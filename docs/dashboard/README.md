#### Patch management with CLN portal (Sticky Tag)


The best way to handle QA and Production environments is to use Sticky Tag feature of KernelCare activation keys issued from CloudLinux Network (CLN) portal.

To use this tag, go to _CLN portal → KernelCare tab → click a key to edit → click Edit Key_.

You should provide a separate key for each environment and set them to a particular sticky tag which is actually the date to which all the servers in an environment have to be patched.

![](/images/kcstickytag.png)

The date in _Sticky tag_ field can be any date from May 28, 2018 up to one day before today.

To use Sticky Tag feature on the servers to be patched, run:

```
$ /usr/bin/kcarectl --set-sticky-patch=KEY
```

Alternatively, you can do the same by adding ` STICKY_PATCH=KEY` to `/etc/sysconfig/kcare/kcare.conf` file.

:::warning Warning
Do not replace the KEY word with the actual KernelCare license key used to register the server.
:::

When the Sticky Tag feature is enabled for particular servers, all such servers will get patches only released before the date specified in the _Sticky tag_ field.

This way, you can add new patches to all the servers in some environment (i.e. registered with the same KernelCare license key) by updating only a single field in the CLN portal.
