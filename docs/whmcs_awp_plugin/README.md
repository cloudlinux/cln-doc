# CloudLinux WHMCS AWP Plugin

[[toc]]

## Overview

AccelerateWP Addon for WHMCS automatically configures "Configurable options" that can be linked to the Product/Service.

When a client orders/upgrade a configurable option, a request will be sent to the server to set the Allowed/Disallowed status for AccelerarteWP Premium features.

## Installation and Configuration

### Installation

1. Your WHMCS must be properly configured to work with cron because sending requests to the server is sent by cron. [How to setting up the cron](https://docs.whmcs.com/Crons#Setting_up_the_Cron_Tasks).
2. Plesk requires the installation of an additional [extension](#plesk-extension).
3. Download archive [https://repo.cloudlinux.com/plugins/whmcs-awp-plugin-latest.zip](https://repo.cloudlinux.com/plugins/whmcs-awp-plugin-latest.zip)  

<div class="notranslate">

```
wget -q https://repo.cloudlinux.com/plugins/whmcs-awp-plugin-latest.zip
```

</div>

3. Unzip the archive to <span class="notranslate">`<whmcs_root>/modules/addons`</span> folder  

<div class="notranslate">

```
unzip whmcs-awp-plugin-latest.zip -d <whmcs_root>/modules/addons
```

</div>

4. If your hosting requires specific files permissions, change them accordingly in the folder: <span class="notranslate">`<whmcs_root>/modules/addons/acceleratewp`</span>
5. Go to the admin panel page WHMCS/System settings/Addon Modules, activate "AccelerateWP Addon"

6. Configure addon:
   1. Enable debug mode if necessary. Logs are stored in the "System Module Debug Log"
   2. Allow administrator access to the addon page to view information about the status of the servers

### Setting prices for "Configurable options"

During addon activation, "Configurable options" AccelerateWP are created automatically (System settings/Configurable Option/Group name "AccelerateWP")

:::tip Notes
Don't change the name of the group, options and sub-options!
:::

In the AccelerateWP group settings, you need to configure:
* Choose for which products (cPanel/Plesk) you can additionally order the service.
* For the "accelerate_wp_premium|AccelerateWP Premium" option, set the cost.

In the option price settings, there are two options, On and Off. Adjust prices as you see fit.

### AccelerateWP Addon page

In case the configurable options "AccelerateWP" were accidentally removed, you can re-install them on the AccelerateWP addon settings page.

The table shows the queue and history of requests to the servers for which the AccelerateWP status change will be applied.

:::tip Note
Deactivating the addon will delete the table with the history of AccelerateWP activity on the servers.

### FAQ

#### How WHMCS communicates with end-server

The addon tracks the change in the order and services of the client.  
For those client services that have the configurable options "AccelerateWP", a request is sent to the server to change the status of AccelerateWP products.

Requests are sent by cron once at the beginning of every minute.

Information about the servers to which requests were sent can be viewed on the addon page.

If an error occurs, you will be able to retry the request on the addon page.

The AccelerateWP module enters the "Allowed" status when the client service's status is set to "Active" and the configurable options "On" is selected.

## Plesk extension

The extension adds the ability to execute the <span class="notranslate">`accelerate-wp-admin set-suite`</span> command to the Plesk XML API.

Do not install it if you are not using AccelerateWP WHMCS billing integration.

:::tip Note
Requires Plesk version 17.0 or higher  
The Plesk extension is available since accelerate-wp-1.3-2 version
