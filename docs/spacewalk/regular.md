#### CloudLinux Spacewalk


Spacewalk is an open-source systems management solution for system provisioning, patching, and configuration.

If a user bought a license directly via CLN UI (not via vendors), he can use Spacewalk to manage his servers when they have been activated with the activation key.

To get to Spacewalk, go to _CloudLinux OS â†’ Activation Keys_. On the left sidebar menu click _Open Servers_ panel, the CloudLinux Spacewalk application opens in a new tab.
